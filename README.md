# Support Vector Machines - SDTSIA210

This project, developed for the SDTSIA210 course at Télécom Paris, provides a comprehensive exploration of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for binary classification. Implemented within a Jupyter Notebook, this project not only demonstrates the practical application of both Linear and Non-linear SVMs using the scikit-learn library but also delves into the fundamental mathematical concepts underpinning these algorithms.

## Concepts Covered

## Linear SVM
A **Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM)** is a supervised learning algorithm used for binary classification tasks. It works by finding the optimal hyperplane that best separates two classes in a dataset. This hyperplane maximizes the margin between the classes, ensuring a clear distinction with the fewest classification errors.

## Non-Linear SVM
A **Non-Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM)** is an extension of the linear SVM that handles data that cannot be separated by a straight line (non-linearly separable). It uses the **kernel trick** to project the input data into a higher-dimensional space, where a linear hyperplane can then be used to separate the classes.
